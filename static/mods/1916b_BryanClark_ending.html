As your wife Mary said to you back in June, fourth time’s the charm! You have won the Presidency in your own right! Insider Republicans are gobsmacked by this outcome, and down ballot Democrats have gained massive majorities in both chambers of Congress. Even the Republican strongholds of Vermont and Maine repudiated Roosevelt, states which haven’t bucked the Party since its rise to prominence in 1856. Roosevelt is reportedly despondent due to this crushing loss, and plans to leave office ahead of schedule to allow you to begin your term early. </p><p>The war situation in Europe is already in disarray. Common infantrymen and generals alike are wondering how the tide of the conflict will shift, but the front is already descending into chaos. French troops are mutinying due to low pay and desire for peace, and rumors abound regarding an upcoming German Spring offensive.  But none of this matters to you. With this large of a victory, you can unilaterally withdraw American forces without much opposition. If you manage to enact your agenda for the common man and keep your promise of bringing American troops home, you should have no problem defeating whatever unity candidate the Republican Party nominates in 1920."

As your wife Mary said to you back in June, fourth time’s the charm! You have won the Presidency in your own right! The size of your victory is impressive, and really illustrates your mastery of utilizing this political environment to your advantage. German-Americans express their satisfaction with your victory by sending you bratwurst and liverwurst in such quantities that your house starts to smell strongly of meat. Roosevelt will leave office an extremely unpopular president, but knowing his character he may just try and win the entire war before March 4th. </p><p>The war situation in Europe is already in disarray. Common infantrymen and generals alike are wondering how the tide of the conflict will shift, and the French Army is teetering on the brink of mutiny. With this win, you definitely have enough of a mandate to simply withdraw U.S. forces without a final settlement. Your victory makes it clear that the American people are tired of war, and you should be thankful that you no longer have to bog yourself down in fruitless peace negotiations. If you manage to enact your agenda for the common man and keep your promise of bringing American troops home, you should have no problem defeating whatever unity candidate the Republican Party nominates in 1920."

As your wife Mary said to you back in June, fourth time’s the charm! You have won the Presidency in your own right! This victory is what was expected by most insiders in both parties, but that doesn’t cheapen the value of your triumph. A legion of your supporters in Miami even decide to throw you a victory parade, complete with banners from your 1896, 1900 and 1908 campaigns. Roosevelt will leave office an unpopular president, but knowing his character he may just try and win the entire war before March 4th. </p><p>The war situation in Europe is already in disarray. Common infantrymen and generals alike are wondering how the tide of the conflict will shift, and mass confusion has gripped the continent from Paris to Moscow. It remains unclear how you will actually broker a final peace between the Allies and Central Powers, but with your solid victory there may be enough domestic support for a simple withdrawal of U.S. troops. American involvement in this nightmarish conflict could be over as soon as March 1917. If you manage to enact your agenda for the common man and keep your promise of bringing American troops home, you should have no problem defeating whatever unity candidate the Republican Party nominates in 1920."

As your wife Mary said to you back in June, fourth time’s the charm! You have won the Presidency in your own right! Even though this victory is narrower than was expected by most columnists and Democratic insiders, you still are President-elect, and that is all that matters at this moment. Roosevelt will leave office a divisive figure, but knowing his character he may just try and win the entire war before March 4th. </p><p>The war situation in Europe is already in disarray. Common infantrymen and generals alike are wondering how the tide of the conflict will shift, and the British press reports loud festivities in the German trenches upon hearing news of your victory. It remains unclear how you will actually broker a final peace between the Allies and Central Powers, or if you will withdraw U.S. forces as a symbol of good faith in future negotiations. Whatever happens, it may be best to brush up on your French and German as soon as you can.

Your fourth bid for the Presidency has failed, and it is unlikely you will be given an opportunity to launch a fifth. Despite the political tailwinds of an unpopular war, domestic disorder and a fractured Republican Party, you have lost by a narrow margin. It may have been your overt progressivism, or your inability to expand your appeal beyond rural voters, but you were unable to win several key states regardless. </p><p>As elated as the British and French are with this outcome, the Democratic establishment is not amused by your loss. After four straight defeats there is almost Party-wide consensus that the next Democrat to run for the Presidency should be a fresh face on the national scene. Many already see promise in Iowa’s Herbert Hoover, the progressive head of the U.S. Food Administration, or Franklin Delano Roosevelt, New York’s new Governor-elect and Theodore Roosevelt’s fifth cousin. The future may be bright after all."

Your fourth bid for the Presidency has failed, and it seems you will not be given an opportunity to launch a fifth. Despite the political tailwinds of an unpopular war, domestic disorder and a fractured Republican Party, you not only lost but lost by a solid margin. Your attempts to assemble a viable anti-war coalition have failed. </p><p>This stunning defeat has reinvigorated Republican progressives while dividing the Democratic establishment. With four straight presidential losses, Democrats find themselves confused on which direction to take the Party. The 1920 nomination will probably see a pitched battle between progressives and conservatives, each blaming the other for this string of defeats. Party stalwarts are hoping Roosevelt will fumble his next term so badly that it won’t matter who ends up on the ticket in four years. One question continues to haunt you, however: would taking that meeting with those German agents have altered this outcome?"

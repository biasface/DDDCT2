A thought pops into your head: <em>Oh dear God. I am so sorry Franklin.</em> 70 miles north at his mother’s house in Hyde Park, Franklin Delano Roosevelt finds himself in disarray by the fireplace. He has lost the New York Governor’s race in a landslide, and he believes this is due to the downstream effects of his fifth cousin’s nearly complete victory in the general election. Franklin’s wife Eleanor comforts him: </p><p>”Uncle Theodore adores me and has no ill-will for you, Franklin. Perhaps you can find a spot in his administration?” At that moment, Franklin perks up. He has an idea. “Oh Eleanor, you genius. I shall see if I can become Assistant Secretary of the Navy!”"

Your position a few months ago seemed as dire as it could have been, with your party deeply divided and your abysmal standing in the polls. All of that abated, and now Bryan has to deliver his fourth concession speech. To add insult to injury, you have carried the Plains, Bryan’s home region. The state of the Republican Old Guard is obviously irrelevant, as you have outmaneuvered them to such a degree that their influence didn’t even end up mattering in the slightest. </p><p>You receive congratulatory telegrams from Prime Ministers Asquith and Briand, in addition to a tricolor from King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and an embroidered Astrakhan hat from Czar Nicholas II. Across the Western Front, an informal truce is established as British, French and American troops celebrate your victory. The Germans, on the other hand, feel crushed by Bryan’s loss. If you manage to steer the Allies to victory and handle demobilization with grace, running for a fifth term in 1920 could be possible. If there is anyone who can do it, it is you."

Despite reports of an improving war situation and the outpouring of sympathy surrounding the death of your youngest son, you have narrowly lost reelection. The Old Guard of the Republican Party is unsure how this loss sways their fortunes. Your ability to almost achieve victory in this tough environment has reinvigorated the progressive wing of the GOP, and some political bosses fear you might try yet another comeback in 1920. In the meantime you can feel satisfied that you weren’t completely swept aside by Bryan, and that you still have four months left in office which can be spent winning this War. </p><p>The war situation in Europe is already in disarray. Common infantrymen and generals alike are wondering how the tide of the conflict will shift, and columnists in the Allied capitals of Europe are already excoriating the byzantine American electoral system.

For now, retire to Sagamore Hill with Edith, and honor Quenty-Quee’s memory."

The Old Guard of the Republican Party is tepidly celebrating your loss, hoping this is finally the end of your political career.

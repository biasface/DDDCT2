Your gambit of pivoting on the lightning rod issue of civil rights has failed. It was a strategy with some promise due to your weak standing in the polls, but it ultimately hastened your defeat. Even in the event of a House decided election you would still lose: Republicans control at least 25 state delegations. Many insiders agree this interruption of decades of national Democrats’ silence on civil rights was nothing but a political ploy made by an incumbent with his back against the wall, and it seems the Democratic Party is already attempting to distance themselves from this peculiar election.</p><p>After five Presidential bids over the course of three decades, your political career is finally over. Your turbulent term in office combined with your racially progressive pivot certainly makes you the elephant in the room for your Party, and it is likely you have inadvertently ended the political careers of those associated with your administration. Democratic insiders are expecting an uncertain field of candidates in four years, and many are dreading the chaos that awaits the Party in 1924. You don’t have to worry about any of this, however. Retire to Villa Serena, and bask in the Miami sunlight for the rest of your days."

Wow, this has created quite a mess. Your decision to put your finger on the progressive side of the civil rights scale has triggered the first House-decided presidential election since 1824. An addition to the confusion is the presence of 50,000 robed Klansmen from all corners of the country on the National Mall. Their daily marches will probably constrain the flexibility of Southern representatives, and feed the deadlock created by Ellison D. Smith’s stubborn bloc of supporters in the House. You can only hope they don’t create unrest while they parade around the Nation’s capital.</p><p>Unfortunately for you, even if Smith’s Southern delegations were to rally behind him in both chambers, Republican control of the House is so secure that Wood is essentially guaranteed to pick up a majority of at least 25 states’ representatives.

You have done it. Not only have you renewed your Presidency against all odds, you have redefined your position on civil rights and managed to win without the ‘Solid South’. Splinter candidate Ellison D. Smith is livid, along with most other Southerners in Congress, and have vowed to grind your second term agenda to a halt. Democratic insiders are gobsmacked that you managed to flip enough Northern states to win reelection, and many see this course correction on civil rights as a continuation of the blurring of the lines between Republican and Democrat.</p><p>Republicans have gained enormous majorities in both chambers of Congress, and will likely be your main partners in governing these next four years. You will probably have to follow their lead on the tax code and tariffs, a stinging aftershock of your unconventional election strategy. You now have very few friends on an increasingly conservative Capitol Hill. Regardless of what you manage to accomplish in your second term, 1924 will be very interesting.

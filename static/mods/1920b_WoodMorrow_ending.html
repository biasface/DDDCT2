Spitting out his tobacco dip, Wallace turns to the establishment’s owner, Marvin ‘Big Marv’ Hookes, with an angry look on his face. “Can ya’ b’leeve this horseshit? How’d this son’bitch carry ‘Bama? I sure a’ shit didn’t vote for ‘em.” Hookes shoots Wallace a tired glance. He replies glumly, “Jus’ pay for the damn oats, George.

Your long journey from lowly assistant surgeon to the Presidency has finally ended. Even with the political winds at your back, this victory is still impressive. In addition to sweeping Bryan’s home region of the Plains, you have flipped a couple traditionally solid Southern states. Many are shocked you were able to achieve such a margin with Edwin P. Morrow as your running mate, especially after his antics on the campaign trail. But you proved them wrong and then some. Theodore Roosevelt’s children join you for a victory parade in New York City, and gigantic crowds line the bustling avenues of Manhattan. One can hardly see the Sun through the falling ticker tape!</p><p>Adding to your good spirits, Republicans have achieved near-supermajorities in the House and Senate. The conservative coalition in Congress remains, but an influx of moderate freshmen will likely balance them out. You are now free to pursue policies of your choice. Raising tariff rates, pushing for an anti-lynching bill and increasing diplomatic engagement with the great Western democracies will likely be your first priorities in office.If you manage to preside over a period of economic recovery and relative stability at home and abroad, you should have no problem winning reelection in 1924."

You could have faltered on many occasions, but obviously held firm throughout. Many are shocked you were able to achieve such a margin with Edwin P.

With a sigh of relief you collapse into the worn leather armchair in your living room and close your eyes for a moment. <em>This was for you, Colonel. To you I owe the White House; rest in peace, old friend.</em> After this thought you notice a slight breeze filling the room. You chuckle softly. <em>You could never resist making your presence known, could you?</em> </p><p>In addition to your solid victory, Republican majorities in the House and Senate have expanded greatly.

After two days of frustration and false hope, what you thought was the long winding road to the White House has hit a dead end. You know in your heart that it shouldn’t have been this close. With the poor state of the economy, rampant strikes, and rapid advance of Bolshevism in Europe, it seemed your victory was all but assured. You catch your mind racing: <em>That damn Hindenburg. How did he turn things around so quickly?</em> At least it was close. Perhaps historians will uncover something which vindicates your loss, like they did with Samuel Tilden in 1876. </p><p>In the wake of your narrow defeat the GOP finds itself as bitterly divided as it was eight years ago. It is likely your political career is over, as your ticket’s inclusion of Edwin P. Morrow tarnishes your reputation in the eyes of the Old Guard.

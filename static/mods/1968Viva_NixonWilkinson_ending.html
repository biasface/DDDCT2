He had managed to shake the Secret Service, much to their chagrin, and even his wife Pat wasn’t sure where he was anymore.</p><p>“I know what I’m doing. It’s been done before,” Nixon had muttered to himself as he packed up his car and began the nearly 24 hour drive from New York to Dallas.</p><p>Now here he was, crouched in the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository, watching nervously, waiting for Johnson to pass through.</p><p>As the motorcade entered Dealey Plaza, Nixon wiped his brow nervously. He took aim, and froze. He couldn’t believe it. He must be seeing things. As he focused in on the President-Elect, he could have sworn the man looked at him, and winked.</p><p>“No turning back now.”</p><p><em>Bang.</em></p>"

Of course, after Agent Oswald killed his brother, the Warren Commission had been an excellent ploy by Agent Johnson to cover up the whole issue so that Hoover could begin tampering with voter registration. All those riots, all that suffering, were all worth it in the end.<p><p>Of course, he was slightly worried when Agent Sirhan failed in his mission to finish the job, but his plan had succeeded and he would always win in the end. Now that his puppet Nixon had been installed in a historic landslide with Republican supermajorities, it was time to crack down on those Communist radicals and insurgents. The Vietnam War and draft would be continued for decades until every city that those Asian boys had was nothing but a smoldering wasteland, the Civil Rights Act would be repealed so those commies stopped their uppity business and those uppity unions would have their rights stripped away. Hoover chuckled to himself. It was time to lead America into a new age from the shadows."

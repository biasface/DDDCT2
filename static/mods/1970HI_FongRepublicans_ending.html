You hope he finds a good way to contribute to the state's future, despite everything. Regardless, you're gonna have to go back to Washington, so while this victory is sweet you do dread the jet lag...</p><p>Your work in DC is going to be increasingly important. Republicans gained in the Senate, though you'll miss working with guys like Goodell and Gore. However, you still haven't managed to crack open the House of Representatives. When Nixon gives you his congratulations call, he seems to spend more time dwelling on that than telling you good job. Regardless, you're going to stay there and hopefully help the nation progress on key issues, and help end the War in Vietnam with honor. Good luck Senator Fong. Congratulations on making Hawaii proud.</p>"

Despite all of his negativity, he seems to listen well, and wishes you good luck in your future endeavors. You hang up, and are left to stew in your house, another Republican laid waste by Vietnam. You wonder if Hawaii will ever elect another Republican to the Senate...</p><p>Nationally this was a stiff loss. Republicans gained in the Senate, but because of your loss the Democrats still have 55 votes. Hopefully Heftel will conduct himself well in the Senate, and will represent Hawaii with grace and wisdom. Despite how disappointing this is, you should be proud Hiram. You were the first Senator from the State of Hawaii, number one, and you'll always go down in history as that. Congratulations Mr. Fong. Hopefully retirement will treat you well.</p>"

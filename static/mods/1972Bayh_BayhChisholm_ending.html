For African-Americans and women across the country, this is historic too, after you selected Shirley Chisholm as your running mate. <p><p>The hard part starts now. First things first: the war in Vietnam. Then, you can also build out a legacy that is uniquely yours - perhaps a major educational initiative is in order for you. You also have to keep an eye on this emerging Watergate Scandal. Of course, your party is still just as fractured as before. What will you do with the segregationists in the south? What will you do about the McGovernites? Tough terrain lies ahead, but if anyone can handle it, it’s Birch Bayh. Good luck Mr. President! And may God be with you.</p>"

It took until 8 PM before it began to dawn on everyone that not only was Birch Bayh going to be the next President of the United States, he was going to do it by winning all 50 states. Haldeman raged, Ehrlichman swore, and Nixon drank. Pat had already gone off to bed hours ago, and now the President sat completely isolated, as he always was.<p><p>Nixon's mind raced: Had any of the Plumbers talked? Were they in on some massive conspiracy, one big enough to take down the President? As he began to wander the halls, he looked at that portrait, for what must've been the millionth time. “Is this how it ended for you?” he asked the 35th President. Feeling white hot emotion boiling up inside of him, Nixon decided to add some paint to the canvas. Sweating now, he glanced at the nearest Secret Service agent, not paying attention, and with one clumsy move -<p><p>BANG!"

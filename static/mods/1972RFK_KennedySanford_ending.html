Not only have you lost, but you would lose New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and even D.C.<p><p>Pundits are in utter shock as many polls predicted your victory, some by large margins. Some call foul play and investigations were made, but the only clues investigators could find are the words ‘’Bigshot’’ and ‘’Spacebar’’. Politically this defeat is disastrous for House and Senate Democrats as Democrats lose almost every seat they currently hold.<p><p>In the White House, behind the scenes, in the Oval Office, you cry and wonder how this could happen, how could you let both Jack and your father down? The first lady, Ethel, who is pregnant with another child comes and consoles you. Suddenly you hear the windows smash open and two gunmen wearing black suits enter. They fire two shots – one at you, and the other at Ethel. BANG! BANG! After this Secret Service members pour into the Oval Office and quickly detain the shooters. The scene they walk into is frightening. They see a gunshot in the wall, a crying Ethel with blood now stained on her White Dress, and a pool of blood that lies next to her. Then they see it. You are on the ground, dead. They ask Ethel what happened, and she said in tears ‘’He saved me’’. A service is later held for you and people tear up at the story Ethel repeats. You did it, you went down as Jack did, but it was for the greater good. Months later, Ethel gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and he grows up with an interest in politics. Maybe your family’s legacy will be preserved after all? "

Many are waiting for you to make your victory speech after Reagan gives a muffled concession speech. Politically your victory means wonders for House and Senate Democrats, but you likely haven’t gained a supermajority, meaning Republicans could try to use obstruction to make your second term less successful than your first. Regardless, you can still try to make major reforms to the healthcare system and pass some form of universal healthcare in your second term, continue the Great Society programs, and hopefully cool down the tensions of the Cold War since U.S involvement in Vietnam ended. Maybe you can even visit China during your second term, which you failed to do as of now. Whatever you do this will be your last term, so make the most of it and leave a strong legacy for your Democratic successor to continue. Good Luck!"

Later you go above the 270 threshold and give your victory speech while Reagan gives a muffled concession. After you give your speech you decide to go to sleep knowing that you already won. In the middle of the night, you feel someone shaking you to wake you up. You decide to open your eyes and all you can see is a map of the United States in one color. You quickly realize that the person is Joseph Gargan, your campaign manager with a smile on his face. Being half-asleep, you asked Gargan ‘’what is this?’’ and he said ‘’the electoral map’’. Once you can fully comprehend what had happened you woke up Ethel with your cheering. Ethel, still tired said ‘’What is it?’’ Then you show her the map and she begins to smile. After this Gargan leaves the room. Ethel goes back to sleep while you sit in your bed thinking for a bit. Soon you decide to take a trip to a White House balcony. You look up in the sky crying and you say ‘’I did it’’ you take a quick second to wipe tears from your eyes, and when you look up you see stars forming a constellation shaped like a familiar face - your fallen brother and past President, John Kennedy. After you see this you feel tears rush down your eyes again and you wipe your face again. After this, the image is gone and you decide to go to bed feeling emotions that are beyond joy. In the next few years, you can now affect real change in this country.<p><p>Good luck!"

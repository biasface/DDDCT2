Your victory speech was in front of an ecstatic crowd in South Dakota, and everyone could see the tears in your eyes.

But what you've achieved tonight is an astounding victory that political analysts will be studying for decades to come, and the climax of a chaotic past few years.

At a loss for words, Walter Cronkite read the announcement nobody thought he would give at 7:14 PM. It took until 8 PM before it began to dawn on everyone that not only was George McGovern going to be the next President of the United States, he was going to do it by winning all 50 states. Haldeman raged, Ehrlichman swore, and Nixon drank. Pat had already gone off to bed hours ago, and now the President sat completely isolated, as he always was.<p><p>Nixon's mind raced: Had any of the Plumbers talked? Were they in on some massive conspiracy, one big enough to take down the President? As he began to wander the halls, he looked at that portrait, for what must've been the millionth time. “Is this how it ended for you?” he asked the 35th President. Feeling white hot emotion boiling up inside of him, Nixon decided to add some paint to the canvas. Sweating now, he glanced at the nearest Secret Service agent, not paying attention, and with one clumsy move -<p><p>BANG!"

It'll be a miracle if you even hold your senate seat after this beating.<p><p>Additionally, nobody knows where this leaves the Democratic Party after such a divisive primary and a colossal defeat in the general election. Any brand of strong liberalism will be cast aside for a long time, so great job on that front. It's almost certain that a more moderate candidate will be put up in four years, and they'll probably be able to win a single state, unlike you. At least the city of DC stayed blue. Hopefully Nixon stays true to his promise of bringing peace with honor, and can leave the White House with dignity in four years."

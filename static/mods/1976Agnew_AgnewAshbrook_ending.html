Party leaders are disappointed in you to say the least, and there's absolutely no way you can recover from this Mcgovern-esque loss.<p><p>Of course, unlike McGovern or Goldwater, you're not a sitting senator with years of public service ahead of him and a lifetime of accomplishments behind. You're just former President Agnew now, and if Carter campaigned enough down-ballot, an impeachment may remove your right to even that title.

As you drudged yourself to Buchanan's office to have him write you a concession speech, and when hours later you were delivering it, the usual Agnew spark was gone. None of the classic decrying of liberal institutions, no swearings or alliterations, just a short and boring concession speech, delivered by a lame duck.<p><p>Of course, some small part of you knows that this is what was always going to happen, right? Making Goldwater seem moderate, and with metric tons more personal and political baggage, somehow winning your own term was a pipe dream. But still, it hurts a little bit to not even make history as the candidate with the least electoral votes in history. You're confined to being between Goldwater and McGovern, middle of the road. Mediocre is what history will describe you as, and you're nothing more than a footnote, the 3-month president."

This is perhaps the best you could hope for after the twin debacles of Watergate and Maryland. The work still isnt done, however. Carter will sell the nation to the devil, and the Democrats will let loose all manner of children into white schools, and there's only one man in politics who sees how things are today.<p><p>Of course, you have a legion of devoted followers who will back you all the way, and after a warm reception on Firing Line you've found perhaps your true calling. Signing a deal with ABC to form your own syndicated news program, you'll perhaps be the only voice in the media that fights for the people of America against satanism, liberalism, and elitism. It helps of course, that your outrageous program is generating massive ratings for the ABC network.

Maybe there's a place for you somewhere in the party? The conservative wing that was just breaking out of its shell 14 years ago has almost entirely eclipsed Rockefeller and his lousy liberals, and you've made no small part in that.

Some are calling for recounts in close states, but Carter has called to congratulate and concede defeat as Democrats despair.<p><p>In spite of your turning of the tides to take control of the White House, the Democrats still made gains in the House and Senate. Any legislation you’re hoping to pass probably has to be paired down to be more palatable to the peaceniks in Congress. Maybe you can make up for it in the midterms.

Carter’s careless campaigning has left him unpopular among his former supporters, who cannot comprehend his collapse during such an easy election.<p><p>But before you get Buchanan to write a speech broadcasting your big break, the Democrats have still managed to retain a majority in Congress, meaning you’ll have to moderate your more monumental legislation.

Police are barely managing to keep the crowd gathered outside the White House from jumping the fence and making their displeasure with you known personally.<p><p>Impeachment proceedings are speeding through congress, finding support among both parties. It’s likely you’ll be the first president to be removed from office, unless you make like Dick and resign. Speaking of Dick, you’ve managed to retroactively throw his win in ‘72 into doubt with this. Rumor has it that Carter is coming down to demand your impeachment himself. As for what’s next, never before has this nation faced an election this important rigged on such a scale, some are calling for Carter to take office, while some are just calling for a redo of this election.

The Republicans are sure to be eager to move past this, and the 1980 primaries are going to be exceptionally interesting. Will it be Connally? Reagan? Bush?

In a rare display of PSI members keeping their mouth shut, even some high-ranking members weren’t in the know. “It’d all be worth it in the end” you thought to yourself, desperately trying to justify what you did, but the guilt never fully went away.

Five years ago you were the favorite to win the presidency, didn’t win but came back to lead the Socialists and regained some lost ground, but now even that has vanished. Italy is now a two-party state, between those who are corrupt and those who are communists. Whoever the next leader of the Socialists is has a big mess to clean up.

The Italian Socialist Party will retain its unique position where it’s neither a small party like the Republicans or Liberals, but not a big one like the DC or PCI either.

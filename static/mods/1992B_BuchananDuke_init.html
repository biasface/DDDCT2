He then looks at the TV screen near his desk, realizing nothing had changed from 10 seconds ago, despite him hoping it would. 538? Five hundred and thirty-eight electoral votes to Pat Buchanan and David Duke? How was this possible? He went to a filing cabinet near the door and rifled through a number of well-organized documents, and extracted a small packet of paper from it. He had always kept a thorough file of all major legislation he passed that might come up for debates, or press questions. That is what a leader with competence would do, right? He sat down at his desk, trying to read the words on the page. It was hard, as, outside the White House, he could hear constant commotion from the police and some people, protesting his administration’s actions. The loud, repeated chant of “AMERICA FIRST, DUKAKIS IS THE WORST” towering over it all. Finally, he found the words he needed. “...and the individual alternative minimum tax rate increased from 21% to 24%...”. So he didn’t accidentally raise it to 42% without anyone telling him. What could have caused this then? He just wanted to prevent a market…*CRASH*! Dukakis spins around to his left to see a window shatter next to him, with some tall men with “America First” merchandise and a few firearms in hand standing there. He immediately started to regret asking his secret service to give him some time alone. One of the men bellows HEY DUKAKIS IF YOU LOVE TAXES SO MUCH, HOW ABOUT I GET YOU TO PAY YOUR DEATH TAX?-- BANG BANG!!\";}else if (quickstat[0]>=270) {return \"<h3>“WHAT.

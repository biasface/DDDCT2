You have won the 1996 election with a full electoral sweep!”</h3><br> Even with your popularity, booming economy, and early lead, no one expected this resounding success when your bid for re-election started. Not only are you the first Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to be re-elected, you’re the first President since Washington to win by a complete electoral sweep, beating out Nixon’s victory over McGovern twenty four years ago! It’s highly unlikely that this victory will be topped, even if new states join the union.<br><br> With this resounding success it’s clear that the American people stand fully behind your promises, even if congress might not be so kind. With luck this resounding success will cause the reversal of the Republican Revolution and deliver Democratic Dominance back to both chambers of congress. But for now, don’t worry about that, you’ve achieved the greatest victory you could have hoped for in your final election, sit back and bask in it."

If you can pass that, along with some sort of foreign policy win, you’ll be remembered highly, and will leave Vice President Gore a nice platform to run on, should he seek the presidency in 2000. Just keep your head up, and don’t do anything stupid. Don’t blow it."

Everyone is reminded of the shock and despair felt by Democrats watching the 1994 election results come in. Newt Gingrich is loving this, and your defeat here will be remembered as the final part of a massive strategy utilized by the Republicans, beginning in their revolution 2 years ago. All of that is over now though, and you’ll be just a one term president, as Bob Dole plans to move into the Oval Office. The “Comeback Kid” you are not. <br><br> You probably won’t get another shot at this in 2000, as your party is furious that you blew such great circumstances for an incumbent. Expect a more conservative turn in key issues like Medicare, the economy, abortion, and taxes. Maybe Hillary can try this one again at a later point..."

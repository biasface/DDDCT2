But still, the magnitude of this loss stings. Though you’ve managed to stay ahead of Mondale’s loss in ‘84, it’s not by much, with you performing worse than even Barry Goldwater.<br><br> Many are quick to blame you for this loss, but others are blaming factors out of your control like the Reform Party and the actions of other Republicans in congress. Whatever the case is, Clinton’s place in the White House was easily secured, and has put into doubt not only the ability of the Republicans to take the White House in 2000, but survive the midterms with a majority. As for you, it’s probably time to retire. Just focus on the highs of your career, rather than this final low."

Though you’re still ahead of the big losers like McGovern, Landon, and Mondale, your performance being just sub-par stings, not even making history as one of the worst performing candidates.<br><br> The mood around the Republican National Headquarters is noticeably subdued, a loss like this, while sad, is hard to even get mad about. There’s no second guessing, shouting, and shifting blame, just some half hearted “we’ll get 'em next time”s and planning to make sure that they’ll hold on in the midterms. Though your career is over, more due to your age than anything, you probably have a spot at some Republican think-tank or as spokesman for a private company.

Bill Clinton will remain president for the next four years, but your party stands a good chance of taking back the White House in 2000.<br><br> Your political career is over, with your age, but you can retire in peace and with respect, after a life of public service in Washington. Hopefully President Clinton will take a conciliatory approach to his second term, particularly with such a divided Congress in front of him. You can always watch from the sidelines, and become an advisor to future Republicans, or maybe even become a spokesman for some private company. Here’s to you, Bob Dole."

Newt Gingrich and other Republicans are absolutely ecstatic at this turn of events, and many Democrats crushed by the news, some demanding recounts in close states.<br><br> As for your policies, reforming Medicare is your top priority, along with tax cuts and other conservative policies.

Many thought your campaign was hopeless after the stunts House Republicans pulled in 1995, especially as the economy began to boom. But it seems the American people wanted a more conservative lean to their politics, and your ascendancy to the White House comes as the culmination of a years-long battle to retake Washington with the Republican Revolution.<br><br> Medicare remains the top priority right now, but reshaping the world as the only global superpower, with China on the rise, is also now your responsibility.

Republicans the nation over celebrate fiercely, while Clinton is no doubt getting the dressing down of his life from any one who can reach him for blowing such a massive lead.<br><br> With the Republican Revolution completed, with unexpectedly comfortable margins, now is the time to set America right, starting with finding a solution to medicare, and possibly dealing with China as a rising superpower.

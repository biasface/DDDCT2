Never.It’s awful the fraud the corrupt Democrats thought they could get away with, I mean c’mon, did anyone really believe Gore won that big 4 years ago?</p><p> Even these supposedly liberal states, the ones that supposedly voted for Gore back in 2000 and 2004, like New Jersey. New Jersey, great state, y'know I’m from New York, I’m a bit biased, but it’s great that when those New Jerseyites came in they were for us. I know this great guy here, Dr. Mehmet Oz! I’m glad tonight he won election to the Senate here, we’re really breaking that 60 Seat ceiling the fake news media said we’d never reach. I’ve got a great pal too, over in NYC, a guy named Lee Zeldin! He’s over there, winning those deep blue seats in the city… Trump Tower is about to be represented by a true patriot!</p><p>Here’s the thing, here’s the deal folks, because of how bad I beat them tonight, the corrupt Democrats are gonna start with the fraud again, and we’re gonna need to stand up to it. You can bet that over the next four years I’m gonna crack down on fraud, and lock up the people who rigged Al Gore into office, and that could be Phony Al himself.</p><p> President Trump would serve for 8 years, followed by 8 years of his Vice President, Doug Mastriano. </p>"

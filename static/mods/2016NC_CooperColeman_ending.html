Dan Forest successfully defeated your runningmate in the Lieutenant Gubernatorial race, and your working relationship with him is sure to be tense over the next four years. In addition, Republicans still control the legislature and are already taking action to limit your power as governor. Good luck Governor Cooper, you are going to need it."

It seems that North Carolina has shifted to the right in recent years, as Republicans won a large majority of the elections that occurred throughout the state last night, including your former position as Attorney General. This loss is going to sting for a while."

It is even more disheartening considering that Donald Trump and Lieutenant Governor Forest were able to win their respective elections in the state. Perhaps the negative media coverage of your campaign was too much or perhaps Roy Cooper was a far more popular attorney general than you had believed. Either way your governorship of North Carolina is over in two months so make the best of it. Maybe you can try again in 2020 or even become a senator later down the road."

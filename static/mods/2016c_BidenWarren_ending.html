Donald Trump will come to power with a mandate, and you, and Barack Obama will both retire, leaving behind the Obama-Coalition to other hands. Perhaps Democrats can win in 2020, but it’s unlikely you’ll have much of a part in it, besides being blamed for losing a winnable election. Hillary Clinton is already planning on writing a book about the defeat, putting most of it on you, and perhaps launching a 2020 campaign, along with Bernie Sanders, and you’re own VP nominee, Elizabeth Warren. In the coming weeks, even Barack Obama will privately come out against the way you ran your campaign. Regardless of what happens, pack for Delaware."

It’s time for you to retire. But who knows, if things go poorly for Trump, and you play your cards right, you could have comeback in 2020, that’s if Democrats are willing to trust you, which looks shaky at best. Already Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and you’re VP nominee Elizabeth Warren are being floated as possible nominees for 2020, and breaking into that field as a proven failure would be hard.

The night was going well, and you were already preparing to give a victory speech, when you learned Trump had narrowly squeaked out a win. Democrats everywhere, including you’re VP nominee Elizabeth Warren, feel let down, and perpetually start looking for someone to blame, Clintonites, Berniebros, and other groups within the party are blamed by different factions, and inter-party civil war seems to have broken out. The election was tight, and though there is a deal of blame on you, at the end of the day you barely lost, and if you wanted a 2020 comeback wouldn’t be unreasonable, and in a divided and hostile primary, you might once again be able to swoop in the primary, but regardless 2020, is a long time from now, you need to start packing for Delaware!

Even Donald Trump, though claiming victory, by means of the House, and Senate control by Republicans, has signaled to this being very unusual. Time will tell how your future could play out, but if the American people regard this election as more of a tie, then a win for Trump, you could have a serious shot at 2020, that is, if Hillary, and Bernie don't want a rematch after 2016.

Both you and Hillary are excited to get to work - But now it’s time to decide on your cabinet. Will you stick with many of Obama’s choices?

You have won the 2022 Pennsylvania Senate election.</h3><p>Although Fetterman led the early polls, you have managed to turn the tides of this race and ride the red wave to victory. Your win against such an experienced opponent has upset many predictions, and has drawn comparisons to Trump’s surprise win in Pennsylvania in 2016. You have also made history as the first Muslim to serve in the United States Senate.<p><p>The way that you will vote in the senate is now up for speculation. Will you return to your roots as a moderate Republican? Will you continue to serve the conservative base? As someone with very little experience, the ball is truly in your court. Hopefully you can satisfy your constituents and win a second term in 2028."

Still, the national Republicans are not happy that you pushed aside the experienced conservative candidates in the primaries, only to lose against Fetterman in a red wave year.<p><p>Most news organizations never took your campaign seriously, and your loss only solidifies this notion. Although there may be more opportunities in the future, your political future does not look very bright. Perhaps you can return to the entertainment industry?"

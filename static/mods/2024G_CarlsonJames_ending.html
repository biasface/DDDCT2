The nation is flabbergasted and calls of outright voter fraud begin in earnest. It seems that regardless of Newsom’s political failings, you were just too radical to gain any traction among the American people. The Democrats have even regained their majorities in the House and Senate, with 54 Senate seats and counting. You can bet McConnell will prevent them from doing anything too radical with the filibuster, but the GOP no longer has the power to filibuster any Supreme Court Nominees and so Newsom will probably stack the empty spots with liberal justices, destroying conservative legislation for centuries.<p><p>Unfortunately, the blame for this absolute catastrophe falls squarely onto you. After you refused to make a concession call to Newsom, more moderate and traditional conservatives like Dan Crenshaw and Adam Kinzinger are already calling for a ‘return to normalcy’ in our party. You’d best get ready for retirement because your base turned against you too much for you to just go back to FOX and there’s no way the Republicans are letting you near the presidency again after such a devastating defeat."

The nation is flabbergasted and calls of outright voter fraud begin in earnest. It seems that regardless of Newsom’s political failings, you were just too radical to gain any traction among the American people and Newsom successfully wove the line between his urban and rural base. However, your saving grace is that your coattails were just enough for Republicans to keep their majority in the Senate, meaning that you’ve effectively doomed Newsom to the same partisan gridlock that Clinton had.<p><p>Still, Republicans are frustrated that they’ve come up short for the fifth time in 20 years. It’s likely that whoever the new Republican candidate in 2028 is, they’ll be cut from the same neoliberal mold as Newsom and Romney because of your failure. FOX News is still open for you though, so prepare to spend the next few years sandbagging Newsom for every mistake he makes."

If even a few thousand votes in key swing states changed, the election would be looking very different. Minority groups and traditional Democratic voters are at least happy that they won’t have to deal with you as the President, but both Republican supermajorities have remained stable and Mitch McConnell is already stating that the closeness of the election means that President Newsom doesn’t have a mandate to appoint Supreme Court Justices, meaning he’ll essentially be gridlocked the same way Clinton was. It seems that despite your controversy, Gavin Newsom’s elitism was just too much for Middle America.<p><p> Republicans are frustrated that they’ve come up short for the fifth time in 20 years, but you performed better than Paul Ryan did four years ago and proven your positions as a strong force in Republican circles. You could easily run again in 2028 if you want to or return to your old position at FOX, either way, you’ve come across this election with more publicity than ever before and the ball is in your court."

A Democratic bastion that hasn’t voted for a Republican in its entire history and you won it just like that? Nearly all Democrats and some Republicans are accusing you of widespread voter fraud but somehow, though countless recounts, the results are holding, Newsom’s had a stroke and hasn’t been seen since D.C. was called and President Clinton has been foaming at the mouth for days saying something about a bigshot cheat? It looks like the end of the Democratic Party. Progressives are blaming moderates for being too moderate and moderates are blaming progressives for being too progressive.
